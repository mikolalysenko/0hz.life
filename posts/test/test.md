# Escaping alienation and procrastination

If I believed in astrology, 2016 would've been the year of my saturn return.  It was a time of great personal change.  Without going into too much details,

* I quit graduate school,
* Moved to Oakland,
* Tried working at a start up, burned out and quit,
* Separated from my girlfriend,
* Became homeless and lived in a squat,
* Went on a crazy cross country road trip to Coney Island,
* Started a [worker owned cooperative](https://bits.coop),
* Lost 25lbs and learned how to hand stand,
* Moved to Hawaii.

I'm now living off grid on an active lava flow by the pacific ocean.  Here's the view from my deck:

Life finally feels like it is settling down a bit.  One of my goals is to try to get back into blogging and toward this end I'm starting a new website, [0hz.life](https://0hz.life).  All the things I've previously written at 0fps will remain online and the URLS will stay intact but I'm going to post my new stuff here.  

Part of the reason for starting a new site is that I want to get out of wordpress.  I would rather store my writing in plain files, not some cumbersome content management system's database.  This makes it easier to work offline (which happens frequently out here), but more importantly also paves the way for eventually hosting all my content on a decentralized data store like IPFS or dat.

Also I want to break out of the oppressive perfectionism and procrastination which was holding me back.  Maybe by starting this new thing I can keep the bar low enough and the content small enough that I can stay focused and produce consistent updates.  To do this I'm going to experiment with linking to content that isn't just writing but also includes small technical demos or modules that I've written over time.  We'll see how it goes.
